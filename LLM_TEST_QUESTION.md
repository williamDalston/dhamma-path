# 🧘‍♀️ Meditation Timer Bug Fix Challenge

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM
I have a meditation timer that's **partially working but broken**. The timer counts down internally (setInterval is working), but the **visual display doesn't update**. The display stays stuck at "10:00" even though the timer is actually counting down.

## 📊 CURRENT BEHAVIOR
- ✅ Timer starts when button clicked
- ✅ Timer counts down internally (logs show timeRemaining: 1200 → 1199 → 1198...)
- ✅ updateDisplay() function is called
- ✅ All DOM elements are found correctly
- ❌ **Timer display text doesn't change visually**
- ❌ **Progress ring doesn't move**
- ❌ **Status text doesn't update**
- ❌ **Duration dropdown doesn't affect timer**

## 🔍 KEY EVIDENCE
**Console logs show:**
```
Start button clicked! PointerEvent {isTrusted: true, pointerId: 6, width: 1, height: 1, pressure: 0, …}
Current state: {isRunning: false, isPaused: false, timeRemaining: 1200, totalTime: 1200}
Starting timer...
Setting up setInterval...
=== SETINTERVAL TICK ===
timeRemaining before decrement: 1200
timeRemaining after decrement: 1199
About to call updateDisplay...
updateDisplay called
```

**But the display text stays "10:00" and never changes!**

## 🎯 THE CHALLENGE
**Find the exact cause and provide a working fix** for why `window.updateDisplay()` is being called but the DOM elements aren't updating visually.

## 📝 PROVIDE:
1. **Root cause analysis** - What's preventing the display from updating?
2. **Complete working solution** - Show the exact code changes needed
3. **Explanation** - Why your fix works

## 🔧 CONSTRAINTS:
- Must work with the existing HTML structure
- Must maintain all current functionality
- Must be a minimal, clean fix
- Must work on mobile and desktop

## 🏆 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Timer display updates visually (10:00 → 09:59 → 09:58...)
- Progress ring moves as timer counts down
- Status text updates ("Ready to begin" → "Meditating...")
- Duration dropdown changes timer display immediately
- All buttons (start/pause/reset) work correctly

**This is a real production bug that needs to be fixed. Your solution will be tested immediately.**
